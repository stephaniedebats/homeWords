Mr. Baird, a local craftsman, was the builder.The house is basically original. The nook in the hall was Charles's office. The bath had a claw foot tub and a pedestal sink. The cabinet to the left of the kitchen sink was a ""cooler"" for perishables. There was an ice box on the back porch with weekly ice deliveries. There was a new electric clothes ""wringer washer"" on the porch as well.The Riders raised a family and lived there for the rest of their lives.Charles, was born in Stockton, California and Vesta was born in Tennessee. Vesta Rider was well thought of in Redwood City. She was involved with civic volunteering and was active in gaining the women?s right to vote.Charles Rider was also well liked in the community. He was a graduate of Cal Davis when it first opened. He was somewhat of an inventor.The Rider children attended Lincoln School which used to be just on the other side of Whipple Avenue, and at that time, could be seen from the front porch looking to the left. Children and grandchildren attended Sequoia High School, a highly regarded school just down the street.Please try to look beyond the benign neglect-mess to see the beauty of this home.Charles's daughter lived to be 101 years old and wasn't able to maintain the house. The elderly family lawyer who managed it, and is still practicing law at 93 years old, let the house get into this condition. I'm truly sorry for that. ---Alvah Chapple, Executor and Grandson of Charles Rider",2016,4,1207,0.161467486819,"[u'sell', u'cash', u'bedroom', u'bathroom', u'square', u'feet', u'fixer', u'upper', u'locate', u'minute', u'downtown', u'sequoia', u'station', u'shopping', u'center', u'safeway', u'retail', u'restaurant', u'foods', u'street', u'location', u'location', u'location', u'prime', u'location', u'shopping', u'dining', u'entertainment', u'school', u'commute', u'large', u'porch', u'run', u'length', u'make', u'great', u'outdoor', u'space', u'addition', u'brick', u'yard', u'access', u'live', u'room', u'nice', u'sized', u'yard', u'concrete', u'patio', u'kitchen', u'laundry', u'room', u'outdoor', u'space', u'hardwood', u'floor', u'traditional', u'wood', u'burn', u'fireplace', u'separate', u'dining', u'room', u'glass', u'french', u'door', u'walk', u'closet', u'bedroom', u'bonus', u'room', u'laundry', u'room', u'breakfast', u'nook', u'amazing', u'location', u'neighborhood', u'mature', u'tree', u'line', u'street', u'commuter', u'paradise', u'hwy', u'right', u'whipple', u'cross', u'street', u'connect', u'hwy', u'close', u'sequoia', u'caltrain', u'station', u'bart', u'francisco', u'bay', u'destination', u'dog', u'main', u'street', u'dog', u'mile', u'minute', u'open', u'sunrise', u'light', u'night', u'extend', u'use', u'bit', u'fixer', u'upper', u'certain', u'fix', u'fixer', u'upper', u'little', u'bit', u'love', u'story', u'elwood', u'charles', u'vesta', u'rider', u'build', u'mr', u'baird', u'local', u'craftsman', u'builder', u'basically', u'original', u'nook', u'hall', u'charles', u'office', u'bathroom', u'claw', u'foot', u'tub', u'pedestal', u'sink', u'cabinet', u'leave', u'kitchen', u'sink', u'cooler', u'perishable', u'ice', u'box', u'porch', u'weekly', u'ice', u'delivery', u'new', u'electric', u'clothes', u'wringer', u'washer', u'porch', u'rider', u'raise', u'family', u'live', u'rest', u'live', u'charles', u'bear', u'stockton', u'california', u'vesta', u'bear', u'tennessee', u'vesta', u'rider', u'think', u'involve', u'civic', u'volunteer', u'active', u'gain', u'woman', u'right', u'vote', u'charles', u'rider', u'like', u'community', u'graduate', u'cal', u'davis', u'open', u'somewhat', u'inventor', u'rider', u'child', u'attend', u'lincoln', u'school', u'whipple', u'avenue', u'time', u'see', u'porch', u'look', u'leave', u'child', u'grandchild', u'attend', u'sequoia', u'high', u'school', u'highly', u'regard', u'school', u'street', u'try', u'look', u'benign', u'neglect', u'mess', u'beauty', u'charles', u'daughter', u'live', u'year', u'old', u'wasn', u'able', u'maintain', u'elderly', u'family', u'lawyer', u'manage', u'practicing', u'law', u'year', u'old', u'let', u'condition', u'truly', u'sorry', u'alvah', u'chapple', u'executor', u'grandson', u'charles', u'rider']",0.189816549611,0.227565012217,0.0,0.12738722598,0.453773312231

First time on the market since 1974! It's an amazing home with old world charm in the charming and historic Hayward Park neighborhood. ""Why fit in when you were born to stand out"" Dr. Seuss -- Generations ago, the porch was the ""living room"" of the home. It was the social spot; a place to converse with neighbors, cool off in summer and watch kids as they played in the front yard. Porch swings and glasses of lemonade became symbols of the simple life, but as houses, neighborhoods and air conditioning evolved, families headed indoors or to the backyard instead. Today, the ""front porch"" is making a comeback as homeowners look to bring back those days of ""life on the front porch"" with glasses of Bordeaux! This porch will make you feel like you are at Cavallo Point, the Lodge at the Golden Gate, where they offer dining on their front porch just like you will be able to do right here at your own home! -- ""Hayward Park is a historic neighborhood with plenty of charm"", Hayward Park has been mostly untouched over the years by development and still maintains its original charm and historic feel. The neighborhood is walking distance to downtown San Mateo and is anchored by Central Park to the north, San Mateo's largest and most popular public park. -- Hayward Park real estate has plenty going for it. The neighborhood is characterized by tree-lined residential streets and is located within an easy walk of San Mateo's vibrant downtown. Bordered by El Camino Real (west), South B Street (east), 10th Avenue to the north and roughly 17th Avenue to the south, the district is full of attractive, vintage homes built during the first three decades of the 20th century. Early homes (a few built before World War I) are in the Craftsman style popular at the time. Far more are the Tudors, Mediterraneans and English cottages in vogue during the 1920s. -- HISTORY: ""What New Rochelle is to New York, what Evanston is to Chicago, Hayward Park will become to San Francisco, the home town of the class of professional men and women of refinement and intellect."" Such was developer Baldwin & Howell's ambition, expressed in a 1907 sales brochure, for the San Mateo neighborhood built on the former deer paddock of banker Alvinia Hayward's estate. Hayward built his home, also called Hayward Park, in 1880. It later became the Peninsula Hotel, only to burn spectacularly to the ground in 1920. -- What Baldwin & Howell envisioned eventually came to life in San Mateo Park. The neighborhood has enjoyed a recent surge in popularity as an alternative to other close-in districts like Baywood and Aragon, though at much more affordable prices. -- Your new home is conveniently located in between Silicon Valley and San Francisco. You are close to Hwy-92 connecting you with Hwy 101 and 280 for your travels to San Francisco, East Bay and San Jose. Commuters paradise because you are close to Caltrain and BART both taking you to major cities up and down the Peninsula, SF and East Bay. In fact, Hayward Park has another perk for its homeowners: its own CalTrain station. The Hayward Park station is at Leslie and Gum Streets, at the neighborhood's western border. You can walk to downtown San Mateo and not have to worry about finding or paying for parking so you can just enjoy all the casual to fine dining options anytime you feel like it. Effortlessly, enjoy all the events held at Central Park, e.g., ""Music in the Park"" that kicks off on June 25th on Thursday evenings and is a great time! -- This is a lovely vintage one story 4 bedroom, 2 full bath home with formal dining room and waiting just for you.",2015,7,912,0.375085246647,"[u'contract', u'local', u'refer', u'white', u'seek', u'new', u'family', u'ready', u'embrace', u'care', u'memory', u'time', u'market', u'amazing', u'old', u'world', u'charm', u'charm', u'historic', u'hayward', u'neighborhood', u'fit', u'bear', u'stand', u'dining', u'room', u'seuss', u'generation', u'ago', u'porch', u'live', u'room', u'social', u'spot', u'place', u'converse', u'neighbor', u'cool', u'summer', u'watch', u'kid', u'play', u'yard', u'porch', u'swing', u'glass', u'lemonade', u'symbol', u'simple', u'life', u'house', u'neighborhood', u'air', u'conditioning', u'evolve', u'family', u'head', u'indoors', u'backyard', u'instead', u'today', u'porch', u'make', u'comeback', u'homeowner', u'look', u'bring', u'day', u'life', u'porch', u'glass', u'bordeaux', u'porch', u'feel', u'like', u'cavallo', u'point', u'lodge', u'golden', u'gate', u'offer', u'din', u'porch', u'like', u'able', u'right', u'hayward', u'historic', u'neighborhood', u'plenty', u'charm', u'hayward', u'untouched', u'year', u'development', u'maintain', u'original', u'charm', u'historic', u'feel', u'neighborhood', u'walk', u'distance', u'downtown', u'anchor', u'central', u'north', u'large', u'popular', u'public', u'hayward', u'real', u'estate', u'plenty', u'go', u'neighborhood', u'characterize', u'tree', u'line', u'residential', u'street', u'locate', u'easy', u'walk', u'vibrant', u'downtown', u'border', u'el', u'camino', u'real', u'west', u'south', u'street', u'avenue', u'north', u'roughly', u'avenue', u'south', u'district', u'attractive', u'vintage', u'home', u'build', u'decade', u'century', u'early', u'home', u'build', u'world', u'war', u'craftsman', u'style', u'popular', u'time', u'far', u'tudor', u'mediterranean', u'english', u'cottage', u'vogue', u'history', u'new', u'rochelle', u'new', u'york', u'evanston', u'chicago', u'hayward', u'francisco', u'town', u'class', u'professional', u'man', u'woman', u'refinement', u'intellect', u'developer', u'baldwin', u'howell', u'ambition', u'express', u'sale', u'brochure', u'neighborhood', u'build', u'deer', u'paddock', u'banker', u'alvinia', u'hayward', u'estate', u'hayward', u'build', u'call', u'hayward', u'late', u'peninsula', u'hotel', u'burn', u'spectacularly', u'grind', u'baldwin', u'howell', u'envision', u'eventually', u'come', u'life', u'neighborhood', u'enjoy', u'recent', u'surge', u'popularity', u'alternative', u'close', u'district', u'like', u'baywood', u'aragon', u'affordable', u'price', u'new', u'conveniently', u'located', u'silicon', u'valley', u'francisco', u'close', u'hwy', u'connect', u'hwy', u'travel', u'francisco', u'bay', u'jose', u'commuter', u'paradise', u'close', u'caltrain', u'bart', u'take', u'major', u'city', u'peninsula', u'francisco', u'bay', u'fact', u'hayward', u'perk', u'homeowner', u'caltrain', u'station', u'hayward', u'station', u'leslie', u'gum', u'street', u'neighborhood', u'western', u'border', u'walk', u'downtown', u'worry', u'find', u'pay', u'parking', u'enjoy', u'casual', u'fine', u'dining', u'option', u'anytime', u'feel', u'like', u'effortlessly', u'enjoy', u'event', u'hold', u'central', u'music', u'kick', u'evening', u'great', u'time', u'lovely', u'vintage', u'story', u'bedroom', u'bathroom', u'formal', u'dining', u'room', u'wait']",0.0,0.222493748571,0.0,0.210034638087,0.565524606371

Built in 1907 this grande home was originally the neighborhood grocer's home. Auntie acquired this wonderful home in 1927 and it has been in the family ever since. 

Appreciate the grand staircase leading to the wide front porch that is waiting for a pair of andirondack chairs to sit in and watch the world go by. 

Enter thru the beautiful glass and wood front door and be escorted into the formal parlor to wait to be received by the homeowner or entertained by the soft piano music. Enjoy the rounded wall of large windows overlooking the front yard and porch.

The adjacent dining room is spacious, sunny and welcoming. It features classic built-ins, a large fireplace and wonderfully large windows providing reading light to the wide upholstered window seat. The built-in cabinet adjacent to the kitchen was originally open between the rooms to aid serving during formal dinners. Note the very high and beautifully coved ceilings and 11"" baseboards adorning the hardwood floors. They just don't build home like this anymore.

The spacious kitchen is the heart of the home and has several different areas, including the inner sink area, the range and counter area and a very large dining area for the extended family. Don't miss the days-gone-by built in pantry cabinets. 

Beyond the family kitchen is the smaller of the two full bathrooms, with a hidden shower stall behind the door. Welcome to the back hall with room for a desk and the bonus room with gorgeous french windows that overlook the trees and the backyard. This room currently has washer/dryer hookups, but it is really too charming to only do the laundry in.

There are two large bedrooms filled with light and separated by a large bathroom with a pedestal sink, and bathtub and built in medicine cabinets. The front bedroom is also large, has large windows and overlooks the front porch.

The backyard is private and covered with trees, including both redwood trees and fruit trees and crying out for a hammock. There is plenty of room for a fire pit, playing or parking. The choice is yours. The lot is 175' from front to back, which is about 75' deeper than the norm. The grocer's original garage waits quietly to be updated.
